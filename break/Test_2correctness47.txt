The following test case uses the ‘log append’ program with the ‘-E’ option and a guest argument of ‘muller’ and ‘-G’ option and a guest argument of ‘muller’ at different time stamps 1 and 3 respectively . The test case is categorised as correctness violation because the name arguments of guests and employees can be the same however in this case the program does no accept the arguments.
